# OpenGL Clion Template

## What is it?
This is a designed to be a starting point for learning/developing **OpenGL** in **Clion**.
>[!NOTE]
>as of now, this project is only configured to work using the **CMake** compiler

## Why should I use this?
The most tedious and frustrating part about first lerning OpenGL has to be getting everything setup. To save you from the pain I've setup this project with everything you would need to start developing.
